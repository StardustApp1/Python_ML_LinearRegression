Linear Regression Project for predicting US Housing Price

USA Housing
The USA Housing dataset consists of various real estate metrics, including average income, house size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and house prices. The primary objective of the analysis was to explore the factors affecting house prices in the US and build a predictive model for estimating property values.

Through EDA and visualization techniques, it was observed that Average Area Income and House Size had the strongest impact on house prices. A positive correlation was found between these variables, meaning wealthier neighborhoods with larger houses tend to have higher property values. Conversely, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, while important, showed weaker correlations, suggesting that overall house size plays a more significant role than the number of individual rooms.

A Linear Regression Model was then applied to predict housing prices based on key factors. The model performed well, with a high RÂ² score, indicating that a significant portion of price variations can be explained by the selected features. Residual analysis confirmed that the model had a balanced error distribution, making it a reliable tool for estimating home values.

The findings highlight the importance of location and house size in determining property prices. Real estate investors and policymakers can use these insights to identify profitable investment areas and understand market trends more effectively.
